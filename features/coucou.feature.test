Feature: User
    I need to be able to retrieve, create, update and delete users trough the API.

    # "@createSchema" creates a temporary SQLite database for testing the API
    @createSchema
    Scenario: Create a user
        When I send a "POST" request to "/users" with body:
            """
            {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Tester"}
            """
        Then the response status code should be 201
        And the response should be in JSON
        And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json"
        And the JSON should be equal to:
            """
            {
                "@context": "/contexts/User",
                "@id": "/users/1",
                "@type": "http://schema.org/Person",
                "email": "test@example.com",
                "memberOf": null,
                "name": "Tester"
            }
            """

    Scenario: Create a user with invalid email
        When I send a "POST" request to "/users" with body:
            """
            {"email": "test@example", "name": "Tester"}
            """
        Then the response status code should be 400
        And the response should be in JSON
        And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json"
        And the JSON node "root->hydra:description" should contain "email: This value is not a valid email address."

    Scenario: Get single user
        When I send a "GET" request to "/users/1"
        Then the response status code should be 200
        And the response should be in JSON
        And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json"
        And the JSON should be equal to:
            """
            {
                "@context": "/contexts/User",
                "@id": "/users/1",
                "@type": "http://schema.org/Person",
                "email": "test@example.com",

                "name": "Tester"
            }
